This analysis of NYC flights revealed that flights later in the day are likelier
to be late.

```{r, warn = FALSE, echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
df %>%
  group_by(time = round(sched_dep_time, -1)) %>%
  summarize(pct_delay = mean(delayed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = time, y = pct_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  ggtitle("Later Flights More Likely to be Late") +
  stat_smooth()

ggsave(here::here("dir_demo/plots/delay_plot.png"))
```

# Appendix: Model
```{r}
summary(mod)
